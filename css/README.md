# Reynard CSS

Custom CSS to make LibreWolf *very* minimalist. Many UI elements are removed, and some things might break.

## Installation

Copy `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` to your LibreWolf profile's `chrome` directory:
- Linux: `~/.librewolf/[profile]/chrome/`
- Flatpak: `~/.var/app/io.gitlab.librewolf-community/.librewolf/[profile]/chrome/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/LibreWolf/Profiles/[profile]/chrome/`

Restart LibreWolf.

See the CSS files for details.
